# analyze-the-Electric-Production
This pyhton project performs an in-depth time series analysis on an electricity production dataset using pandas, NumPy, Plotly, and statsmodels. It begins by loading and preprocessing the dataset, converting the date column to a datetime format, setting it as the index, and handling missing values using forward filling, then visualizes the raw time series using Plotly to understand the trend and variations. Next, it explores autocorrelation by computing and plotting the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) before and after differencing, helping to identify dependencies in the data. Then further analyzes trends and seasonality using rolling statistics and seasonal decomposition, breaking the series into its trend, seasonal, and residual components. It also calculates and visualizes Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) to determine the order of autoregressive terms. Additionally, the Durbin-Watson test is applied to check for autocorrelation in residuals. These steps help in understanding the underlying patterns and making informed decisions for time series forecasting and modeling, such as ARIMA or other predictive techniques.
